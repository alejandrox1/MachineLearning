# Machine Learning

The goal of this repo is to contain a clean implementation of various Machine Learning algorithms along with a concise 
and self-contained explanation of how every algorithm works.

This project will be updated in stage (which may change as I keep working):
* Supervised Learning Algorithms (almost done)
* Clustering
* Other Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
* Deep Learning
* ... Too many ideas.

Check back at the end of each month for more updates!
