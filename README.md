# Machine Learning

The goal of this repo is to contain a clean implementation of various Machine Learning algorithms along with a concise 
and self-contained explanation of how every algorithm works.

This project will be updated in stage (which may change as I keep working):
* [Supervised Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/alejandrox1/MachineLearning/tree/master/supervised_learning)
* [Unsupervised Learning]()
* [Deep Learning](https://github.com/alejandrox1/MachineLearning/tree/master/deep_learning)
 
This repo is under constructiong and will continue to be updated at regular intervals!
